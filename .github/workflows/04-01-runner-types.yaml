    #  GITHUB (MICROSOFT) HOSTED RUNNERS
    ######################################
    #  GitHub provides hosted runners which run on Microsoft Azure.
    #
    #  Open source projects get some free usage and pro/team/enterprise GitHub
    #  subscriptions also come with some number of minutes included (after which
    #  you pay based on usage.
    #
    #  These are the easiest to get started with (require no additional configuration
    #  and it makes sense to use the free minutes, but only on workflows which are not in the
    #  critical path for your production deployments. For usage beyond your quota I suggest
    #  looking at the below options for higher performance (and more affordable)
    #  approaches!

  #  3RD PARTY HOSTED RUNNERS
  ######################################
  #  There are companies which host GitHub Action runners that provide increased performance for less $$$
  # 
  #  One such company happens to be the sponsor of the course! 🙏
  # 
  #  ✨ Namespace Labs (https://namespace.so/) ✨
  #
  #  You can likely cut your build times (and your CI bill) signiticantly by using their runners
  #  and it only takes changing a single line of yaml:
  #  
  #  - runs-on: ubuntu-24.04 
  #  + runs-on: namespace-profile-default # The default as of July 2025 is Ubuntu 22.04
  #
  #  (They also offer MacOS and Windows runners!)
